/**
 * Test support for {@link CommandHandler} or {@link CommandHandlerDefinition}. This class can be used in favor of the
 * {@link CommandRouter} to test command handling logic without interacting with the {@linkplain Client event store},
 * solely relying on a set of {@link StateRebuildingHandlerDefinition}s. No {@linkplain EventUpcaster event upcasting},
 * {@linkplain EventTypeResolver event type resolution}, or {@linkplain PropagationUtil#propagateMetaData(Map, Map,
 * PropagationMode) meta-data propagation} is involved during test execution. <strong>Be aware that no
 * {@link Command.SubjectCondition}s will be checked either.</strong>
 *
 * <p>This class follows the <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/GivenWhenThen.html">Given When Then</a> style of
 * representing tests with a fluent API supporting:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>{@linkplain Given given} state initialization based on in-memory events and meta-data
 *   <li>{@link Command} {@linkplain Given#when(Command) execution} to execute the {@link CommandHandler} under test
 *   <li>{@linkplain Expect assertions} to verify the command executed as expected, including verification of the events
 *       published by the command handler under test
 * </ol>
 *
 * A typical test case using {@code this} may look as follows. The {@link StateRebuildingHandlerDefinition}s needed to
 * mimic event sourcing as well as the {@link CommandHandler} definition under test have been omitted for brevity.
 *
 * <pre>
 *     {@literal @Test}
 *     public void bookAdded() {
 *          UUID bookId = UUID.randomUUID();
 *          CommandHandlingTestFixture
 *              // specify state rebuilding handler definitions to use
 *              .withStateRebuildingHandlerDefinitions(...)
 *              // specify command handler (definition) to test
 *              .using(...)
 *              .givenNothing()
 *              .when(
 *                  new AddBookCommand(
 *                      bookId,
 *                      "Tolkien",
 *                      "LOTR",
 *                      "DE234723432"
 *                  )
 *              )
 *              .expectSuccessfulExecution()
 *              .expectSingleEvent(
 *                  new BookAddedEvent(
 *                      bookId,
 *                      "Tolkien",

 *                      "DE234723432"
 *                  )
 *              );
 *     }
 * </pre>
 *
 * In lack of the event store, for {@link StateRebuildingHandler.FromObjectAndRawEvent#on(Object, Object, Event)} and
 * {@link StateRebuildingHandler.FromObjectAndMetaDataAndSubjectAndRawEvent#on(Object, Object, Map, String, Event)} the
