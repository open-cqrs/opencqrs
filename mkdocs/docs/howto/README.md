# Guides

This section provides step-by-step guides that demonstrate how to apply the [concepts](../concepts/README.md) in practice.
They focus on practical implementation details and best practices for working with the {{ custom.framework_name }}.

The following guides are currently available:

- [Registering Explicit Event Types](explicit_type_registration/index.md) – Learn how to declare and register event types so that the system can reliably identify, serialize, and deserialize them.
- [Upcasting Events](upcasting_events/index.md) – Understand how to evolve existing events to new versions, ensuring compatibility as your domain and event schemas change over time.

Additional guides will be added over time to cover more advanced usage patterns and common scenarios.
