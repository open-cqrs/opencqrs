# OpenCQRS Documentation

Welcome to the official documentation for **OpenCQRS** – an **open-source application framework** for building systems with **CQRS** and **event sourcing** on the **JVM**.

OpenCQRS is designed to work seamlessly with **[EventSourcingDB](https://www.eventsourcingdb.io)**, making it straightforward to model, implement, and operate event-driven applications. Built with **Java** and **Kotlin** developers in mind, it provides ready-to-use building blocks for **commands, events, aggregates, projections, and testing** – all with a strong focus on **clarity, testability, and maintainability**.

OpenCQRS is developed and maintained by **[Digital Frontiers GmbH & Co. KG](https://www.digitalfrontiers.de/)** and released as **open source software** under the **Apache 2.0 license**. It is free to use and backed by professional expertise and consulting services when you need them.

## Learning the Concepts

New to **CQRS** or **event sourcing**, or wondering how OpenCQRS can help you build applications? Start here:

- **[Getting Started](/tutorials)**

      Step-by-step tutorials that guide you through building your first applications with OpenCQRS.

- **[Guides and How-Tos](/howto)**

      Practical recipes for solving common problems and implementing specific features.

- **[Reference](/reference)**

      Detailed reference documentation for **commands, events, aggregates, projections,** and the **ESDB client SDK**.

- **[Concepts](/concepts)**

      Background explanations of the core ideas behind OpenCQRS and its design principles.

## Platform and Integration

OpenCQRS runs on the **Java Virtual Machine** and is fully compatible with JVM-based languages such as **Java** and **Kotlin**. It integrates seamlessly into modern application stacks:

- Available from **Maven Central** for both **Maven** and **Gradle** builds
- Smooth integration with **Spring Boot** for rapid application development and production deployment
- Native support for **EventSourcingDB** as the underlying event store, with a dedicated **Java client SDK**
- Built-in support for **testing command logic** with fixtures and utilities
- **Modular architecture** for extension and customization
