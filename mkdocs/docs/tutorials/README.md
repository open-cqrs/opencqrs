title: Getting Started with Open-CQRS
description: Learning the core concepts and how to build CQRS/ES applications
---

Welcome to the __Getting Started__ series for [Open-CQRS](../index.md)! This tutorial series will guide you through the 
core concepts and practical implementation of CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) using our framework. 
Whether you're new to CQRS or looking for a structured approach to building scalable and resilient applications, 
this series will provide you with a solid foundation.

## What You'll Learn

Throughout these six tutorials, you will step through the key aspects of developing a CQRS-based system:

1. [Setting Up the Environment](01_setup/index.md) – Learn how to install and configure the necessary dependencies to get started.
2. [Command Handling](02_command_handling/index.md) – Understand how to define and process commands that modify the system's state.
3. [Developing the Domain](03_domain_logic/index.md) – Model your domain logic effectively to enforce business rules and maintain consistency.
4. [Handling Events](04_book_reminder/index.md) – Discover how to capture and react to domain events, ensuring proper event-driven behavior.
5. [Building Read Models from Events](05_catalog_projection/index.md) – Learn how to generate and maintain efficient read models for querying data.
6. [Testing the Domain](06_testing/index.md) – Explore strategies for writing robust tests to validate your domain logic and ensure system reliability.

## Who Should Follow This Series?

- **Developers** looking to build applications with CQRS and Event Sourcing.
- **Architects** interested in designing scalable, decoupled systems.
- **Anyone curious about (Open)-CQRS** and looking for a practical introduction with real-world examples.

Each tutorial includes clear explanations, code examples, and practical exercises to help you gain hands-on experience.
